Analysed 50k news articles using a full NLP and graph-based pipeline. Built
TF–IDF features (1–2-grams), applied K-Means for global topics, and computed
sentiment over time and publications. Constructed a document similarity graph
using 5-character shingles, MinHash, and LSH, then detected communities with
the Louvain algorithm. Compared clustering structures using contingency tables
and Adjusted Rand Index, and visualised topic and sentiment patterns.
