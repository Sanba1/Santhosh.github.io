# Programming Language Toolchain for GCL

**Tech:** F#, Parsing, Compilation, Interpreters, Static Analysis, Verification, Model Checking  

Built a full toolchain for the Guarded Command Language (GCL): implemented a
parser and AST generator, compiler to Program Graphs, and an interpreter for
execution sequences. Added static analyses including sign analysis and
information-flow security checks, applied program verification techniques, and
used model checking to analyse concurrent programs. Demonstrated end-to-end
understanding of language tooling and program analysis.
