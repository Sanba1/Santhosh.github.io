# Powerlifting Performance Data Analysis & ML Pipeline

**Tech:** Python, Pandas, PCA, Ridge/Logistic Regression, ANN, Cross-validation  

Processed 18k+ powerlifting records: cleaned malformed values, standardised
features, and explored distributions and correlations. Performed PCA (first two
components captured ~85% variance) to understand strength-related structure.
Built regression and classification models (Ridge, Logistic Regression, ANN),
used nested cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and statistical tests
(paired t-tests, McNemar) to compare models. Found ANNs slightly outperformed
linear baselines.
